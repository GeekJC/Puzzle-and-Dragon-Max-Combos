    "\n",
    "From here we can further simplify the problem. Given that we can relocate the elements with any arrangement we want, the initial arrangement can’t provide useful information for us now. All we need to know is the number of different elements. Take above pattern as an example, we can simplify it to a 1-D array A: {6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4}, which equals to the total numbers of the array {A, B, C, D, E, F}. Since there are no possible ways to achieve higher combos with insufficient elements, we can simply find the sum of A % 3, which is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 in this case. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Base on this, we build a simple method to test the score of the grid, named \"find_score_in_simple_way\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when number of A >= 21, there will only be 9 or less free spaces for us to insert the A, that will not be possible to not connect any existing matches. Therefore, starting from A = 21, the combos will decrease with the rise of number of A.\n",

    "2. Method in 1 contains many duplicated and unnecessary arrangements, which the method is very inefficient and unnecessary. As we know the number of each elements are fixed and the elements are identical with in same group. we can find the permutation to be : $\\prod_0^{30} n$ for n being the number of distinct elements. For simple case like A=24, B=6, C=0, D=0, E=0, F=0, the permutation would be 2^24 * 1^6 = 16,777,216. We can use a Depth-First search to implement it. However, it will still suffer from average case where elements are evenly distributed.\n",

Excessive permutations from method 2 would contains many arrangements that they are clearly impossible to gain max. combos.
